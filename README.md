# Etch A Sketch Project #
## The Project ##
This project is from The Odin Project and is about creating a sketchpad game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
## After Completing The Project ##
This was by far the hardest project I did until now, dealing with multiple nodes, functions and referencing them to different divs is tougher than I thought.\
But, this project made me use features that I never used, like commenting, commit very often and debugging. It was a project that I spent time on it for 3 days, and I needed to comment some lines of code before my stream of consciousness ended, and try again on the next day.\
Every time, I was faced with a different problem, and this motivated me to commit every time that I solved it, and try to explain what I did in plain english (English isn't my native language by the way).\
Anyway, I learned a lot with this project, it's very simple visually but hard to write the logic, and after completing it, I feel very accomplished and motivated to continue through The Odin Project!
